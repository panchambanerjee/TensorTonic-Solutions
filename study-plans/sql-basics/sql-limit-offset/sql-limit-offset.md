## LIMIT and OFFSET

`LIMIT` restricts how many rows a query returns. `OFFSET` skips a number of rows before starting to return results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### LIMIT

Returns at most N rows. If the table has fewer rows than N, all rows are returned:

```sql
SELECT * FROM logs LIMIT 100;
```

Without `ORDER BY`, which rows you get is non-deterministic. Always pair `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` when you need a specific "top N" result.

### OFFSET

Skips the first N rows before returning results:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY id LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

This skips the first 20 rows and returns rows 21 through 30. `OFFSET 0` is the default and returns from the beginning.

### Pagination Pattern

`LIMIT` and `OFFSET` together implement pagination:

- Page 1: `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0`
- Page 2: `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10`
- Page N: `LIMIT 10 OFFSET (N-1) * 10`

### LIMIT Without ORDER BY

A common mistake is using `LIMIT` without `ORDER BY`. The database picks whichever rows are fastest to retrieve, which can change between executions. For reproducible results, always sort first.

### Execution Order

`LIMIT` and `OFFSET` are processed last, after `ORDER BY`. The full order: `FROM` then `WHERE` then `SELECT` then `ORDER BY` then `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`.
