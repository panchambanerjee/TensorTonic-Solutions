## The WHERE Clause

`WHERE` filters rows before they reach the result set. Only rows that satisfy the condition are returned.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';
```

### Comparison Operators

Standard operators work on numbers, strings, and dates:

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `=` | Equal |
| `<>` or `!=` | Not equal |
| `<`, `>` | Less / greater than |
| `<=`, `>=` | Less / greater than or equal |

### Combining Conditions

- `AND` - both conditions must be true
- `OR` - at least one condition must be true
- `NOT` - negates a condition

`AND` binds tighter than `OR`. Use parentheses to control evaluation order:

```sql
WHERE (status = 'active' OR status = 'pending') AND age > 18
```

### IN, BETWEEN, LIKE

- `IN (v1, v2, v3)` - matches any value in the list. Cleaner than chaining multiple `OR`s.
- `BETWEEN low AND high` - inclusive range check. Equivalent to `col >= low AND col <= high`.
- `LIKE` - pattern matching. `%` matches zero or more characters, `_` matches exactly one.

```sql
WHERE name LIKE 'A%'      -- starts with A
WHERE name LIKE '%son'     -- ends with son
WHERE name LIKE '_a%'      -- second character is a
```

### NULL Checks

`NULL` represents missing data. You cannot use `=` or `<>` with NULL - they always return unknown. Use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` instead:

```sql
WHERE email IS NOT NULL
```

### Execution Order

`WHERE` runs after `FROM` but before `SELECT`. This means you can filter on columns that are not in your SELECT list, but you cannot use column aliases defined in SELECT within the WHERE clause.
