## Running Totals with Window Functions

A **running total** (or cumulative sum) adds each row's value to the sum of all preceding rows in a defined order. SQL window functions make this straightforward.

### SUM() as a Window Function

When you use `SUM(amount) OVER (...)`, SQL computes a sum for each row based on a **window frame** rather than collapsing rows into groups like `GROUP BY` does.

```sql
SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY txn_date)
```

This creates a running sum across all rows ordered by date. Each row's result includes itself and every row that came before it.

### PARTITION BY Resets the Running Total

Adding `PARTITION BY account` restarts the cumulative sum for each account:

```sql
SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY account ORDER BY txn_date)
```

Row 1 of each account starts fresh. The running total never carries over from one account to the next.

### The Window Frame

When `ORDER BY` appears inside `OVER()`, the default frame is:

```
RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
```

You can write this explicitly with `ROWS` instead of `RANGE`:

```
ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
```

`ROWS` counts individual rows, while `RANGE` groups rows with the same ORDER BY value together. When there are no ties, they behave identically. Using `ROWS` is more precise when you want a strict row-by-row accumulation.

### Why ORDER BY Matters

Without `ORDER BY` in the window, every row sees the same total (the full partition sum). The ordering is what turns a simple sum into a running total - it defines which rows are "before" the current row.
